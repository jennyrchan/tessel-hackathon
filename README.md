watchdog: 
   camera + accelerometer + audio:

   eg you need to leave your computer in a cafe- watches for movement, if someone is trying to access your computer and comes close then it texts you come quick, if the accelerometer detects too much movement then it plays a startling noise (or STOP IN THE NAME OF LOVE), texts you that your stuff has been taken and takes a picture of the burglar 
   servo will start moving on movement- to distract person and make them stop for long enough to take a clear pic and also to make them look at the camera. 
   //if we can use outside APIs: maybe send picture of burglar to an outside source and see if it matches pic of Joe Alves
