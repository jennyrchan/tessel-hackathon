# tessel-mjpeg-consumer


---------------

**This is a fork**

- Defines `MjpegConsumer` as a class
- Eliminates the `buffertools` dependency. That dependency existed only to provide a `concat` method, which is provided by the runtime as `Buffer.concat(...)`
- Eliminates `oldBufferType` mode
- Eliminates invocation without `new`

---------------

  
A node.js transform stream implementation that consumes http multipart mjpeg streams and emits jpegs.

### Install

```bash
npm install mjpeg-consumer
```
  
----------------------  
### Usage
The `mjpeg-consumer` isn't very useful without a writable pipe to pipe jpegs to. I've built the [file-on-write](https://github.com/mmaelzer/file-on-write) stream to write a file every time `write` is called on it. The below example opens a stream to an IP camera, pipes the results to the `mjpeg-consumer` which processes the stream and emits parsed jpegs to the `file-on-write` writer.

```javascript
var request = require("request");
var MjpegConsumer = require("mjpeg-consumer");
var FileOnWrite = require("file-on-write");

var writer = new FileOnWrite({ 
	path: './video',
	ext: '.jpg'
});
var consumer = new MjpegConsumer();

request("http://mjpeg.sanford.io/count.mjpeg").pipe(consumer).pipe(writer);
```
